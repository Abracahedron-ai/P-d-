# Perspective D<cide> Framework Documentation

## üèóÔ∏è **Framework Overview**

Perspective D<cide> is a comprehensive AI-powered framework for dynamic content analysis, categorization, and knowledge organization. It provides a modular, extensible architecture for building intelligent systems that can understand, organize, and process content at scale.

### **Core Philosophy**
- **Emergent Intelligence**: Categories and taxonomies emerge from content analysis, not pre-defined schemas
- **Framework-First**: Designed as a core component that can be embedded in larger systems
- **Zero-Setup**: Minimal configuration required for basic functionality
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for custom behaviors and integrations
- **Production-Ready**: Built for scale with async processing, error handling, and monitoring
